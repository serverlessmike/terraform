## CloudOps Infrastructure
All infrastructure must be established in Terraform.
The version of Terraform in use is 0.11.14, please don't use any other versions, even for testing.
Place new modules in the modules directory and put a Readme in the top level to explain what it does and how to use it.
A subdirectory with test scripts in is a nice-to-have.
Try to keep your code DRY
